![Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeijiRestored/emc-breadcrumb/main/assets/main.png)

## Usage

Open the [website](https://meijirestored.github.io/emc-breadcrumb).

Enter your in-game name. The program will start tracking your location and leave a trace behind you on the map showing your movement. If you are hidden from the minimap, the trace will pause and resume when you are visible again. Check the visibility status on the top left of the map.

If you want to track another player or clear your track, refresh the page and enter the name again.

You can track any player you want, as long as they are online and thier location is visible on the map.
